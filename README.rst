Data analysis
=============

This is the Twipe Mobile Solutions data analysis repository.
Currently, the following data analysis projects are available:

- `Predicting average reading time based on text data <average_reading_time_prediction/README.rst>`_
  : an introduction to machine learning on
  text data. A machine learning model is trained to predict average reading time based on the
  text of an article. After testing, the learnings of the model are investigated to see which
  words lead to the largest average reading time.
